# DJ's Guessing-Game
This game is created as a homework assignment in my Coding Bootcamp.
I'm writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript documents to work together for the first time.
This began as a Hangman styled game and I transformed it into a keypad styled appearance.
You can begin playing when you click the button reading "Click for Clue."
Once the clue appears, choose letters from the keypad. 
Correct choices will disappear from the available letters keypad and reappear in the blank spaces below "Your answer" area. 
Incorrect choices will just disappear from the available letters keypad. 
You'll be alerted to correct and incorrect choices when the words "Yep or Nope" appear below the keypad.
Once all the correct letters are chosen, the words "You won" will appear below the answer.
"Click for clue" again to start playing another game.
